## Description
This project is created for users to track employees information. Specifically Employee names, roles, salary, and managers they report to. You are able to add, remove, and update information through this application.

 -I built this project to better track who's on what team in a company.

 -This allows users to keep track of teams and update information regarding those teams.<

 -I learned how to link up inquirer questions to functions that then communicate with the database.
